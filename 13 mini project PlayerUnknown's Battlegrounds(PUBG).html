        The Maps are the playable area where players are pitted against each other in BATTLEGROUNDS. Within these maps, a red zone‎‎ periodically spawns onto random cities/locations causes explosions within that area and also periodically a C-130 flys over the map and drops an air drop.

        Currently Erangel, Miramar & Sanhok are used for all the game modes. But 1 new map (Map 3) is currently being worked on or going into the pipeline soon to be worked on.</p>

The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games using the film Battle Royale for inspiration, and expanded Solos
        The classic game mode. Complete free for all, kill everyone, be the last one alive.

        Solo, a game mode where you spawn into the world alone and you just rely on your own tactics and skill to push you to the end and be the last player alive.

        Solos FPP (First Person Perspective)
        Solo FPP is based around your normal Solo game mode (as read above), but instead of being in 3rd person this is strictly in 1st person.

        Duos
        For this game mode, you will be paired up with another individual and will compete to be the last ones alive.

        Duos FPP (First Person Perspective)
        Duo FPP is based around your normal Duo game mode (as read above), but instead of being in 3rd person this is strictly in 1st person.

        Squads
        Squad is a gameplay type where players are organized into teams which are then pitted against each other. This is distinct from the classic Free For All (FFA) gameplay mode, where players are free to kill whomever they wish.

        SQUAD, a game mode where you can team up in groups of 2, 3 or 4 players, or if you prefer, you can still play solo and take on everyone alone in the match</p>
